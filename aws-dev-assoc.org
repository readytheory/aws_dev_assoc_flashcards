***** Well, what is it?
One read capacity unit represents one strongly consistent read per second, or two eventually consistent reads per second, for an item up to 4 KB in size

     What's the indictor there are more records and when do you get it
***** answer
      LastEvaluatedKey - after 1 meg data
**** Per partition limits on writing in dynamo
     How much can you write per partition
***** answer
      1000 WCU/second
****** Note
that is up to 1 MB per second per partition
** Load balancers
*** ALB
**** Configuration: Listeners per port                                :drill:
     ALB - how many listeners per port
***** answer
      1
**** Describe high level components of ALB                      :drill:fuzzy:
     Describe high level components of ALB
***** answer
- Load balancer either Connects to Internet gateway or?
- ALB connects to mulitple listeners
- listeners connect to target groups
- Devices can be in multiple target groups



**** Pricing ALB - two measures                                       :drill:
What are two measures for pricing ALB
***** LCU and Hourly (about 20 cents/day)
***** notes
      LCU is the greates charge of 4 measures over an hour
      
    - New connections: Number of newly established connections per second. Typically, many requests are sent per connection. 
    - Active connections: Number of active connections per minute.
    - Processed bytes: The number of bytes processed by the load balancer in GBs for HTTP(S) requests and responses.
    - Rule evaluations: The product of the number of rules processed by your load balancer and the request rate. The first 10 processed rules are free (Rule evaluations = Request rate * (Number of rules processed - 10 free rules).
**** Which OSI level is App load balancer working on                  :drill:
     Which OSI level is App load balancer working on
***** Answer
      level 7 the App layer.
**** Which OSI level is Network load balancer working on           :drill:
     Which OSI level is Network load balancer working on

** Service Distinctions

*** Trusted Advisor

**** vs Inspector                                                     :drill:
     Distinguish Trusted advisor and Insprector

***** Answer
      - Inspector is only for EC2, it runs inside instances on a schedule looking for vulnerabilities
      - Trusted advisor makes cost recommendations and performance, and is premium service
      
**** vs Xray                                                          :drill:
          Distinguish Trusted advisor and Xray

***** Answer                                                     :conjecture:
      Xray gets traces from your applications for debugging - Developers adds instrument to apps
      TA you turn it on to get best pracitics
