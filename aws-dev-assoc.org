    - New connections: Number of newly established connections per second. Typically, many requests are sent per connection. 
    - Active connections: Number of active connections per minute.
    - Processed bytes: The number of bytes processed by the load balancer in GBs for HTTP(S) requests and responses.
    - Rule evaluations: The product of the number of rules processed by your load balancer and the request rate. The first 10 processed rules are free (Rule evaluations = Request rate * (Number of rules processed - 10 free rules).

Distinguish global and local secondary indices
*** Answer:
    

Global secondary index — an index with a partition key and a sort key
that can be different from those on the base table. A global secondary
index is considered "global" because queries on the index can span all
of the data in the base table, across all partitions.

Local secondary index — an index that has the same partition key as
the base table, but a different sort key. A local secondary index is
"local" in the sense that every partition of a local secondary index
is scoped to a base table partition that has the same partition key
value.

   In SQS, To avoid HTTP errors, make sure that the HTTP response
   timeout for [ReceiveMessage] requests is longer than the
   [WaitTimeSeconds] parameter.

   Otherwise the HTTP can timeout before the guy answers when the
   guy is working normally

** SQS polling
   what servers do different polling modes query?

*** answer
    short polling-> subset
    long polling -> all
    
    With short polling, the ReceiveMessage request queries only a
    subset of the servers (based on a weighted random distribution) to
    find messages that are available to include in the
    response. Amazon SQS sends the response right away, even if the
    query found no messages.

With long polling, the ReceiveMessage request queries all of the servers for messages.

   Difference WaitTimeSeconds and Http Response timeout?
*** answer
    WaitTimeSeconds is how long it will wait for a message to becoe available
    Http Response timeout is the underlying http layer that receiveMessage calls
    WaitTimeSeconds should be shorter than The Response Timeout

   describe latency of DynamoDb, what are fastest operations and how
   fast are they, usually
   
*** answer
    for most atomic operations, such as GetItem and PutItem, you can
    expect an average latency in single-digit milliseconds. Latency
    for non-atomic operations, such as Query and Scan, depends on many
    factors, including the size of the result set and the complexity
    of the query conditions and filters.

   Name 5 strategies to reduce latency
***   answer
    
    Reduce the request timeout settings: Tune the client SDK
    parameters requestTimeOut and clientExecutionTimeout to timeout
    and fail much faster (for example, after 50 milliseconds). This
    causes the client to abandon high latency requests after the
    specified time period and then send a second request that usually
    completes much faster than the first. For more information about
    timeout settings, see Tuning AWS Java SDK HTTP request settings
    for latency-aware Amazon DynamoDB applications.

    Reduce the distance between the client and the DynamoDB endpoint:
    If you have globally dispersed users, consider using global
    tables. With global tables, you can specify the AWS Regions where
    you want the table to be available. This can significantly reduce
    latency for your users.

    Use caching: If your traffic is read heavy, consider using a
    caching service, such as Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX). DAX is
    a fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache for DynamoDB
    that delivers up to a 10x performance improvement, from
    milliseconds to microseconds, even at millions of requests per
    second.

    Send constant traffic or reuse connections: When you're not making
    requests, consider having the client send dummy traffic to a
    DynamoDB table. Or, you can reuse client connections or use
    connection pooling. All these techniques keep internal caches warm
    that helps keep latency low.

    Use eventually consistent reads: If your application doesn't
    require strongly consistent reads, consider using eventually
    consistent reads. Eventually consistent reads are cheaper and are
    less likely to experience high latency.

What fielsystem becomes more efficient with greater volumes and why?
*** Answer:

With EFS, overall throughput generally increases as the average I/O
size increases, because the overhead is amortized over a larger amount
of data.  Amazon EFS supports highly parallelized workloads (for
example, using concurrent operations from multiple threads and
multiple Amazon EC2 instances), which enables high levels of aggregate
throughput and operations per second.

*** answer
    

Some policies replace all instances during the deployment or
update. This causes all accumulated Amazon EC2 burst balances to be
lost. It happens in the following cases:

    Managed platform updates with instance replacement enabled

    Immutable updates

    Deployments with immutable updates or traffic splitting enabled

To monitor and trigger an alarm on throughput, use the

concurrency is low and decrease when it is high.

If it always decreases or does not accumulate enough during low

Difference between IAM taks for Fargate and AWS
 - Fargate can only have roles attached to tasks
 - EC2 ca have tasks on both instances and tasks

 -bonus  -- Can solve problem autoscaling doesn't if single user can submit multiple tasks

What's a periodic task?
 -in elastic beanstalk, cron based sumission to queues

Define Elastic Beanstalk Worker Environment
 - each EC2 instance has an SQS queue and daemon that posts to http://localhost

Standard queues offer [at least once] delivery and [best effort] ordering

Alternative queue offering if Standard Queue best effort ordering not sufficient
 - FIFO
 or dev effort: sequence info in each message

Queue based apps should be idempotent meaning:
  - they are okay if the process a message multiple times

For dynamoDb - three requirements for local secondary index
 - same Partition key as base
 - created same time as base table: if you didn't anticipate you can't use it
 - 10 GB limit for item collection (all items with same partition key)

For Dynamo db - an ["item collection"] is [all items with same partition key]
