    - New connections: Number of newly established connections per second. Typically, many requests are sent per connection. 
    - Active connections: Number of active connections per minute.
    - Processed bytes: The number of bytes processed by the load balancer in GBs for HTTP(S) requests and responses.
    - Rule evaluations: The product of the number of rules processed by your load balancer and the request rate. The first 10 processed rules are free (Rule evaluations = Request rate * (Number of rules processed - 10 free rules).

Distinguish global and local secondary indices
*** Answer:
    

Global secondary index — an index with a partition key and a sort key
that can be different from those on the base table. A global secondary
index is considered "global" because queries on the index can span all
of the data in the base table, across all partitions.

Local secondary index — an index that has the same partition key as
the base table, but a different sort key. A local secondary index is
"local" in the sense that every partition of a local secondary index
is scoped to a base table partition that has the same partition key
value.

What is Lambda provisioned concurrency?
*** Answer:
  - once it is invoked, it stays loaded, low latency (avoid cold start)
  - you pay for it as long as its running 
  - provisioned concurrency can be controlled with ASG

What is Execution Record
*** Answer:
 -a lambda artifact in Success/Failure destination
 - has version, request/response context request/response payload

Cloudwatch custom metrics
 - what is Api name and some parms to add a custom metric




lambda DLQ vs on-failure queue?
DLQ is part of version specific and is locked in (fuzzy)


read per second Dynamo calcs - 2:1:.5 for?
 2 rcu per 1 transactional  second
 1 rcu per strongly consistent
 .5 rcu per eventually consistent


 cloud formation to deploy s3 from lamda
 does s3 bucket have to be in same region we run CF in?
 Yes -- even tho s3 is global

 How to connect to VPC with lambda
 by default it can't
 lambda creates an ENI -- it needs private subnet id and security gourp id

 When lambda connects to private subnet, key points
  - need to have a Nat Gateway if it needs internet access
  - time to create dns records can cause timeout
  - the function needs create/describe/delete netowrk interfac
  - included in managed poolicy AWSLamdaVPCAccessExecutionRole

 Requirement on Lambda Fuction/ALB
  - target group and Lambda must be in same account and same region

Maxiumum body of Lambda function call
  - Synchronoou when in ALB 1 meg
  - Synchronous, otherwise 6 MB
  - Asynch 256K

How to encrypt an unencrypted volume
  - it can't be encrypted "in place"
  - you can copy it onto an encrypted volume
  - or you can make a snapshot, make and encyrptetd volume, and copy snapshot to encyrpted volume


What is unpublished version of lambda?
 - the working copy, unversioed, aka $LATEST


Lambda - $LATEST is aka [unpublished]

In API Gateway - what is that allows you to publish different versions aka dev, test -- to different urls from same code
 - stage variables -- they are deployment stages
   Lets you reference the value from API setup

Tell me five Elastic Beanstalk deployment methods
 - All at one
 - Blue Green
 - Immutable
 - Rolling
 - Rolling with additional

Lambda feature to redirect traffic to new version; it's advantage; name of implementation setting
 - Traffic shifting
 - easy backoff
 - routing-config
 Bonus - two versions only

In API gateway, distinguish HTTP PROXY and HTTP integration
  - proxy simply maps path and HTTP method
  - HTTP aka HTTP custom - allows you to specify how data in request/response is mapped to methods
   
Diff between AWS and HTTP integration in API Gateway?
   AWS is and AWS_PROXY for lambda -- proxy is simple mapping
   HTPP and HTTP proxy for ec2 -- proxy is simple mapping

Reasons to choose Memcached over Redis (per TJ):
   - multithreaded
   - cache objects e.g. DB connection
   - Run on large nodes/multi core
   - Scale out and in


What is a local secondary index?
  - it has the same partition key as the main table, different sort key

What is always projected into a dynamodb index?
  - the primary key attributes of the base table

the [primary key attributes] of the [base table] are always projected into a dynamo index

Name it
the [ec2 agent] runs on ec2 instances in ECS

What is a task in EC2
Same as a container - the running reification of an images

What is task definition
Looks a lot like docker compose file, json file used with ECS

For scaling in ECS, ASGs work with [services] in a cluser

Can you run ECS services with Elastic Beanstalk?
Yes
Bonus either single- or multi-container instance


What are two launch types for containers
EC2 launch type and fargate launchtype

Main diff Fargate EC2
Fargate is "serverless" -- you don't manage the EC2 instances.  You
are still responsible/able to configure EC2 instaces iwth EC2

What do you need on an EC2 instance to connect to EC2 clusert
the EC2

Can you put on premises machines into ecs cluster?
No - only Ec2 can run the necessary agent

Where do you find the agent?
/etc/ecs/ecs.config

How do you control acces to ECR docker repo?
IAM

How many containers can be described in a task devinition file?
up to 10

Difference between IAM taks for Fargate and AWS
 - Fargate can only have roles attached to tasks
 - EC2 ca have tasks on both instances and tasks

Can you apply IAM roles to containers after they are launched?
 - not for EC2 types

in what context do you have to worry about bucket names being valid dns names
  - Transfer Accelleration
  - also must be dotless



2 things required to allow specified clients  to get up-to-desults from API Gateway
 - 1 you configure: Tick on require authorization in Cache Settings
 - 2 they configure: include header Cache-Control: max-age=0

Define multicontainer docker environment
  - Ec2 thing -- multiple containers per instance
  What for (tentative) to let you get the most -- communicating over docker network

An Elastic beanstalk [worker environment] allows you to queue up tasks
 -bonus  -- Can solve problem autoscaling doesn't if single user can submit multiple tasks

What's a periodic task?
 -in elastic beanstalk, cron based sumission to queues

Define Elastic Beanstalk Worker Environment
 - each EC2 instance has an SQS queue and daemon that posts to http://localhost

Standard queues offer [at least once] delivery and [best effort] ordering

Alternative queue offering if Standard Queue best effort ordering not sufficient
 - FIFO
 or dev effort: sequence info in each message

Queue based apps should be idempotent meaning:
  - they are okay if the process a message multiple times

For dynamoDb - three requirements for local secondary index
 - same Partition key as base
 - created same time as base table: if you didn't anticipate you can't use it
 - 10 GB limit for item collection (all items with same partition key)

For Dynamo db - an ["item collection"] is [all items with same partition key]

What is advantage of Local Secondary Index?
 - can share read capacity with base table

cloudwatch event vs metric
 - event is a state change in aws resource
 - metric is a measurement sent to cloudwatch

define cloudwatch event
  delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources.

cloudwatch lods, descrite it
  cloudwatch logs [centralizes logs] from systems, apps, and aws services

cloudwatch metrics
 are defined by a name, [a namespace] and zero or more [dimensions]
 dimensions are e.g. "by OS" or "by Region"

cloudatch statistic vs metric
  statistics are based on the metrics over a period of time
  They include minimum, count, sum etc

cloudwatch alram
  an alarm watches [a single action] over [a specified time period]

what do cloudwatch alarms do?
  initiate actions

cloudwatch metrics
  GetMetricData can get up to [500] metrics in one call

What do you call in aws api to publsh metrics to cloudwatch?
  put metric data
