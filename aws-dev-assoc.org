    - New connections: Number of newly established connections per second. Typically, many requests are sent per connection. 
    - Active connections: Number of active connections per minute.
    - Processed bytes: The number of bytes processed by the load balancer in GBs for HTTP(S) requests and responses.
    - Rule evaluations: The product of the number of rules processed by your load balancer and the request rate. The first 10 processed rules are free (Rule evaluations = Request rate * (Number of rules processed - 10 free rules).
